# LeetCode 2179: Count Good Triplets in an Array - A Comprehensive Tutorial

## Problem Description

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `n`, containing the integers from `0` to `n-1` in some order, we need to count "good triplets."

A triplet `(i, j, k)` is considered "good" if:
1. `0 ≤ i < j < k < n`
2. `nums1[i] == nums2[i']`, `nums1[j] == nums2[j']`, `nums1[k] == nums2[k']`
3. `i' < j' < k'` where `i'`, `j'`, and `k'` are the positions of the same elements in `nums2`

In other words, a good triplet consists of three elements that maintain their relative order in both arrays.

## Solution Approach

### Key Insight

The problem is essentially asking: for each element as the middle element (j), how many valid pairs of elements (i, k) can we form such that:
- Element i comes before j in both arrays
- Element k comes after j in both arrays

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. Map each value to its position in `nums2`
2. Process each element in `nums1` as a potential middle element (j)
3. Count:
   - How many elements before j in `nums1` also come before `nums2[j]` in `nums2`
   - How many elements after j in `nums1` also come after `nums2[j]` in `nums2`
4. The product of these two counts gives us the number of good triplets with this middle element

### Using Binary Indexed Tree

We'll use a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to efficiently count elements that maintain their relative order. This data structure allows us to perform prefix sum queries and updates in O(log n) time.

## Solution Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def goodTriplets(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums1)

        # Map each value to its position in nums2
        pos2 = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums2):
            pos2[num] = i
        
        # BIT to count elements
        bit = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        def update(idx, val):
            """
            When inserting a value at index 0 in the original array, 
            we need to update all indices in the Binary Indexed Tree that 
            include index 0 in their responsibility range
            """
            idx += 1  # BIT traditionally uses 1-indexed
            # Continue updating "parent" indices by adding the LSB
            while idx <= n:
                bit[idx] += val
                idx += idx & -idx

        """
        Count elements to the left of this element in nums1
        that also appear to the left in nums2
        """
        def query(idx):
            idx += 1  # 1-indexed for BIT
            result = 0
            while idx > 0:
                result += bit[idx]
                idx -= idx & -idx
            return result
        
        result = 0

        for i, num in enumerate(nums1):
            p = pos2[num]
            left = query(p - 1)
            
            # Count elements to the right of this element in nums1
            # that also appear to the right in nums2
            right = (n - i - 1) - (p - left)

            result += left * right
            update(p, 1)
        
        return result
```

### Understanding the Formula `right = (n - i - 1) - (p - left)`

Let's break down this key formula:

1. `(n - i - 1)`: Total number of elements to the right of position `i` in `nums1`

2. `(p - left)`: Number of elements to the right of position `i` in `nums1` that appear to the LEFT of position `p` in `nums2`
   - `p` is the position in `nums2` of the current element
   - There are `p` elements at positions 0 to `p-1` in `nums2`
   - `left` counts how many elements to the left of `i` in `nums1` are also to the left of `p` in `nums2`
   - So `p - left` counts elements to the left of `p` in `nums2` that are NOT to the left of `i` in `nums1`
   - These must be elements that are to the right of `i` in `nums1`

3. Therefore, `(n - i - 1) - (p - left)` gives us elements to the right of `i` in `nums1` that are also to the right of `p` in `nums2`

### Example Walkthrough

Given:
- `nums1 = [2, 0, 1, 3]`
- `nums2 = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

Step 1: Map values to positions in `nums2`
- `pos2 = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`

Step 2: Process each element in `nums1`:

For `nums1[0] = 2`:
- Position in `nums2`: `p = pos2[2] = 2`
- Left count: `left = query(1) = 0` (BIT is empty initially)
- Right count: `right = (4 - 0 - 1) - (2 - 0) = 3 - 2 = 1`
- Good triplets: `left * right = 0 * 1 = 0`
- Update BIT at position 2

For `nums1[1] = 0`:
- Position in `nums2`: `p = pos2[0] = 0`
- Left count: `left = query(-1) = 0`
- Right count: `right = (4 - 1 - 1) - (0 - 0) = 2 - 0 = 2`
- Good triplets: `left * right = 0 * 2 = 0`
- Update BIT at position 0

For `nums1[2] = 1`:
- Position in `nums2`: `p = pos2[1] = 1`
- Left count: `left = query(0) = 1` (value at position 0 is now in BIT)
- Right count: `right = (4 - 2 - 1) - (1 - 1) = 1 - 0 = 1`
- Good triplets: `left * right = 1 * 1 = 1`
- Update BIT at position 1

For `nums1[3] = 3`:
- Position in `nums2`: `p = pos2[3] = 3`
- Left count: `left = query(2) = 3` (values at positions 0, 1, 2 are in BIT)
- Right count: `right = (4 - 3 - 1) - (3 - 3) = 0 - 0 = 0`
- Good triplets: `left * right = 3 * 0 = 0`
- Update BIT at position 3

Final answer: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

There is one good triplet: (0, 2, 3) mapping to positions (1, 2, 3) in `nums1` and (0, 1, 3) in `nums2`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n log n) - We process each element once and perform BIT operations that take O(log n) time
- Space Complexity: O(n) - For storing the position mapping and the Binary Indexed Tree

## Conclusion

This problem demonstrates the power of Binary Indexed Trees for efficiently solving questions involving order relationships and range queries. By breaking down the complex triplet counting into simpler counting operations, we can achieve an efficient O(n log n) solution for what would otherwise be an O(n³) problem.
