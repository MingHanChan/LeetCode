# Zero Array Transformation Tutorial: Using Difference Arrays

## Problem Statement

**Zero Array Transformation I**: Given an integer array `nums` and a list of range queries `[li, ri]`, determine if it's possible to transform `nums` into a Zero Array (an array with all elements equal to 0).

For each query `[li, ri]`:
- You can select any subset of indices within the range `[li, ri]`
- Decrement the values at these selected indices by 1

Your task is to determine if, after processing all queries, it's possible to make every element in the array equal to 0.

## Approach: Difference Arrays and [Prefix Sums](https://github.com/MingHanChan/LeetCode/blob/master/data%20stucture/Prefix%20Sum.md)

We'll solve this problem efficiently using a difference array, which is a powerful technique for handling range update operations.

### The Key Insight

For each element in `nums`, we need to check if we can decrement it enough times to reach zero. The maximum number of decrements possible for each position depends on how many queries include that position.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isZeroArray(self, nums, queries):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type queries: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        n = len(nums)
        query = [0] * (n+1) 
        '''
        Assume query = [0,0,0,0,0] at begining
        For queries [1,3], set query[1] += 1 and query[4] -= 1
        And now query = [0,1,0,0,-1,0]
        By taking prefix sums of query shows that only positions 1, 2, and 3 were incremented
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        '''
        for l, r in queries:
            query[l] += 1
            query[r+1] -= 1
        query_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            query_sum += query[i]
            if nums[i] > query_sum:
                return False
        return True
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize a difference array**: We create an array `query` of size `n+1` initialized with zeros. This extra position helps handle the end boundary.

2. **Process each query using difference array technique**:
   - For each query `[l, r]`, we set `query[l] += 1` and `query[r+1] -= 1`
   - This marks the beginning and end of the range effect

3. **Convert to prefix sum and check feasibility**:
   - We calculate the running sum of the difference array
   - At each position, this sum represents the maximum possible decrements
   - If any element's value exceeds its maximum possible decrements, return `False`

4. **Return result**:
   - If all elements can be decremented to zero, return `True`

### Understanding the Difference Array

Let's visualize how the difference array works with a simple example:

Imagine we have `nums = [3, 2, 1, 4]` and queries `[[0, 1], [1, 3]]`.

1. Initialize `query = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2. Process query `[0, 1]`:
   - Set `query[0] += 1` and `query[2] -= 1`
   - Now `query = [1, 0, -1, 0, 0]`

3. Process query `[1, 3]`:
   - Set `query[1] += 1` and `query[4] -= 1`
   - Now `query = [1, 1, -1, 0, -1]`

4. Calculate prefix sum:
   - Position 0: `1` (can be decremented once)
   - Position 1: `1 + 1 = 2` (can be decremented twice)
   - Position 2: `2 + (-1) = 1` (can be decremented once)
   - Position 3: `1 + 0 = 1` (can be decremented once)

5. Check against original array:
   - `nums[0] = 3` > `1` decrements: can't reach zero ❌
   - `nums[1] = 2` ≤ `2` decrements: can reach zero ✓
   - `nums[2] = 1` ≤ `1` decrements: can reach zero ✓
   - `nums[3] = 4` > `1` decrements: can't reach zero ❌

Result: `False` (can't transform to Zero Array)

## Why the Difference Array Technique Works

The difference array technique allows us to efficiently track the cumulative effect of multiple range operations:

1. **Adding 1 at index `l`**: This indicates that from index `l` onward, we can perform one additional decrement.

2. **Subtracting 1 at index `r+1`**: This cancels out the effect after the range ends, ensuring that only elements within the range `[l, r]` get the increment.

3. **Taking the prefix sum**: This gives us the total number of times each position can be decremented, considering all queries.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + q) where n is the length of the array and q is the number of queries
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the difference array

This is significantly more efficient than a naive approach that would process each query separately, which would have O(n × q) time complexity.

## Summary

The difference array technique is a powerful tool for handling range update operations efficiently. In this problem, it allows us to determine the maximum number of decrements possible for each position, which we can then compare against the original values to check if transformation to a Zero Array is possible.
