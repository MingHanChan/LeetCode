# Domino and Tromino Tiling: Mathematical Derivation

## Problem Background

The "Domino and Tromino Tiling" problem asks us to count the number of ways to tile a 2×n board using:
- 2×1 domino tiles (which can be placed horizontally or vertically)
- L-shaped tromino tiles (which cover 3 squares)

## State Definitions

To solve this problem, we'll define two important states:

- `dp[i]`: Number of ways to fully tile a 2×i board
- `tromino[i]`: Number of ways to tile a 2×i board with exactly one cell unfilled

## Basic Recurrence Relations

For a fully tiled board of length i, we can:
1. Add a vertical domino to a fully tiled board of length i-1: `dp[i-1]`
2. Add two horizontal dominoes to a fully tiled board of length i-2: `dp[i-2]`
3. Add specific patterns to partially tiled boards of length i-1: `2*tromino[i-1]`

This gives us:
```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2*tromino[i-1]    ... (Equation 1)
```

For a partially tiled board of length i (with one cell unfilled), we can:
1. Add a tromino to a fully tiled board of length i-2: `dp[i-2]`
2. Add a horizontal domino to a partially tiled board of length i-1: `tromino[i-1]`

This gives us:
```
tromino[i] = dp[i-2] + tromino[i-1]    ... (Equation 2)
```

## Mathematical Derivation

### Step 1: Expanding the tromino[i-1] Term

From Equation 2 with indices shifted:
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + tromino[i-2]    ... (Equation 3)
tromino[i-2] = dp[i-4] + tromino[i-3]    ... (Equation 4)
```

Substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3:
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] + tromino[i-3]
```

Continuing this recursive substitution:
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] + dp[i-5] + ... + dp[1] + tromino[1]
```

Since `tromino[1] = 0` (you can't have a partial tiling of a 2×1 board):
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] + dp[i-5] + ... + dp[1]    ... (Equation 5)
```

### Step 2: Working with the dp[i-2] Recurrence

From Equation 1 with indices shifted:
```
dp[i-2] = dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] + 2*tromino[i-3]    ... (Equation 6)
```

Rearranging to isolate 2*tromino[i-3]:
```
2*tromino[i-3] = dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] - dp[i-4]    ... (Equation 7)
```

From Equation 2 with indices shifted twice:
```
tromino[i-2] = dp[i-4] + tromino[i-3]
```

Rearranging:
```
tromino[i-3] = tromino[i-2] - dp[i-4]    ... (Equation 8)
```

### Step 3: Finding a Relationship for tromino[i-2]

Substituting Equation 8 into Equation 7:
```
2*(tromino[i-2] - dp[i-4]) = dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] - dp[i-4]
2*tromino[i-2] - 2*dp[i-4] = dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] - dp[i-4]
2*tromino[i-2] = dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] - dp[i-4] + 2*dp[i-4]
2*tromino[i-2] = dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] + dp[i-4]    ... (Equation 9)
```

### Step 4: Finding a Simplified Expression for tromino[i-1]

Now, from Equation 3:
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + tromino[i-2]
```

Using Equation 9:
```
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + (dp[i-2] - dp[i-3] + dp[i-4])/2
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3] + dp[i-2]/2 - dp[i-3]/2 + dp[i-4]/2
tromino[i-1] = dp[i-3]/2 + dp[i-2]/2 + dp[i-4]/2    ... (Equation 10)
```

### Step 5: Substituting Back into Our Original Recurrence

Substituting Equation 10 into Equation 1:
```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2*(dp[i-3]/2 + dp[i-2]/2 + dp[i-4]/2)
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-4]
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4]    ... (Final!!)
```

## Verifying the Formula

We can verify this formula works correctly for the known base cases:
- dp[0] = 1 Empty board has one way to tile (do nothing)
- dp[1] = 1
- dp[2] = 2
- dp[3] = 5
- dp[4] = 2*5 + 1 = 11 ✓
- dp[5] = 2*11 + 2 = 24 ✓
- dp[6] = 2*24 + 5 = 53 ✓

## Final Solution

The simplified recurrence relation is:
```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4]
```

This elegant formula collapses the complex interactions between dominoes and trominos into a simple recurrence relation that only depends on fully tiled states, eliminating the need to track partially tiled states.

## Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numTilings(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # dp[i] = number of ways to fully tile a 2×i board
        dp_result = [0] * (n + 1)
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 2
        elif n == 3 :
            return 5
        else: # n >= 4
            dp_result[0] = 1
            dp_result[1] = 1
            dp_result[2] = 2
            dp_result[3] = 5
            for i in range(4, n+1):
                dp_result[i] = dp_result[i-1] + 2*dp_result[i-2] + dp_result[i-3] + dp_result[i-4]
        return dp_result[n] % (10**9 + 7)

```

The beauty of this solution is that we've mathematically derived a simple recurrence relation that eliminates the need to track multiple state variables, resulting in an elegant and efficient algorithm.
